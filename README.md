# html-tools-mode

html-tools-mode is an emacs minor mode which extends [web-mode](http://web-mode.org/) to
allow quick formatting of existing text/html files into html5.

Those were originally a bunch of **ad hoc** Emacs Lisp functions
written to speed up formatting of already existent entries for the
[Instituto de Arte Contempor√°neo](http://iac.org.es) website.

## Introduction

Ever had to format legacy pages to move the content to a new design?
Had to work with given text of unknow origin?

## What's the idea

The idea is quickly wrapping regions, words, or whatever in the
elements they should have under your needs.

This is not:

-   a template tool replacement
-   a DOM model manipulator

### Attempt to nest DWIM inline tags doesn't always respect correct nesting

Workaround: use regions to enclose everything correctly if you
already have tags in your text.
