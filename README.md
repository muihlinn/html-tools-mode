# html-tools-mode
Emacs minor mode for [web-mode](https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode).
Quick formatting of already existing text with common markers.

Those were originally a bunch of *ad hoc* Emacs Lisp functions written to speed up formatting of already existent entries for the [Instituto de Arte Contemporáneo](http://iac.org.es) website.


## TODO
* Better documentation, or – actually – documentation
