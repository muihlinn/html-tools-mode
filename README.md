# html-tools-mode
Emacs minor mode for [web-mode](https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode).
Quick formatting of already existing text with common markers.

Those were originally a bunch of *ad hoc* Emacs Lisp functions written to speed up formatting of already existent entries for the [Instituto de Arte Contemporáneo](http://iac.org.es) website.

For now you'll need to apply [this commit](https://github.com/muihlinn/web-mode/commit/aceb7acd75cd06fa7a2793d7017fff305481316b) to web-mode in order to make it work

## TODO
Review list-making functions
Review footnote-making functions
Better documentation, or – actually – documentation
