* html-tools-mode

	html-tools-mode is an emacs minor mode which extends [[http://web-mode.org/][web-mode]] to
	allow quick formatting of existing text/html files into html5.

	Those were originally a bunch of *ad hoc* Emacs Lisp functions
	written to speed up formatting of already existent entries for the
	[[http://iac.org.es][Instituto de Arte Contempor√°neo]] website.
